# Onyx — Overall Tasks Deferred

## Must Have
- [ ] Continue on the file tree and opening markdown files on the UI.

## Experiments
- [x] **Spike: Tauri 2.0 migration** — Completed. Tauri 2.0 + React + TypeScript + Vite + CodeMirror 6 with vim mode. Stack validated and fully adopted.

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Syntax-hiding WYSIWYG mode in CodeMirror (live preview — show styled output, reveal raw markdown on cursor entry)
- [ ] Per-tab view mode toggle (live preview vs raw) persisted in vault config
- [ ] File create / rename / delete from the sidebar context menu
- [ ] Restore last open tabs and cursor positions on launch
